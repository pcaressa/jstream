\doxysection*{What?}

jstream is yet another Json parser. Actually, the Json parsed by jstream is not standard, since there\textquotesingle{}s no Unicode support, just ASCII\+: it was enough for the application I needed, to port it to support Unicode would essentially mean to use {\ttfamily wchar} instead of {\ttfamily char}.

\doxysection*{Why?}

I wrote it in need of a parsed that consume characters from a stream (a text file, a http channel etc.).

\doxysection*{How?}

To use it in your code just include the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{jstream_8h}{jstream.\+h}}} file, that exports two data types and two functions.
