\doxysection*{What?}

jstream is yet another Json parser. Actually, the Json parsed by jstream is not standard, since there\textquotesingle{}s no Unicode support, just ASCII\+: it was enough for the application I needed, to port it to support Unicode would essentially mean to use {\ttfamily wchar} instead of {\ttfamily char}.

\doxysection*{Why?}

I wrote it in need of a parsed that consume characters from a stream (a text file, a http channel etc.).

\doxysection*{How?}

To use it in your code just include the {\ttfamily jstream.\+h} file, that exports two data types and two functions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item type {\ttfamily jstream\+\_\+t}, an alias for {\ttfamily unsigned$\ast$}
\item type {\ttfamily struct jstream\+\_\+param\+\_\+s}, the data type used to pass and receive parameters to and from the function {\ttfamily jstream}
\item function {\ttfamily jstream} that scans a json value from the stream and returns it into a memory block whose address is also returned as value.
\item function {\ttfamily jstream\+\_\+dump} that prints the content of a memory block produced by {\ttfamily jstream} to a text file in Json format.
\end{DoxyItemize}

You need to define a function {\ttfamily int get(void)}, that each time it is called consumes a character in the stream and returns it (or a negative value to denote an error or the end of the stream), and assign its address to the {\ttfamily p-\/$>$ghet} tag of a {\ttfamily struct jstream\+\_\+param\+\_\+s} variable {\ttfamily p}.

After {\ttfamily jstream} has been called, you\textquotesingle{}ll find its return values inside the {\ttfamily p} structure\+: the general scheme is \begin{DoxyVerb}struct jstream_param_s p;
p.get = your_get_function;
jstream(&p);
if (p.error) {
    printf("Error #%i\n", p.error);
} else {
    printf("Address of memory block: %p\n", p.obj);
    printf("Number of items in the memory block: %u\n", p.size);
    printf("Last character scanned from the stream: %i\n", p.clast);
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


The sequence of characters returned by the {\ttfamily get} function is taken by {\ttfamily jstream} to represent a Json value; {\ttfamily jstream} converts it into a bynary format in an array of unsigneds, whose 0-\/th item denotes the type of value, which is enumerated in the jstream.\+h file\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item NULL (0) for {\ttfamily null}
\item TRUE (1) for {\ttfamily true}
\item FALSE (2) for {\ttfamily false}
\item NUMBER (3) for number
\item STRING (4) for string
\item ARRAY (5) for array
\item OBJECT (6) for object
\end{DoxyItemize}

After that it follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If NULL, TRUE or FALSE, nothing.
\item if NUMBER, a double.
\item if STRING, a C-\/string (`'\textbackslash{}0\textquotesingle{}\`{}-\/terminated).
\item If ARRAY, an unsigned n (the number of elements) followed by n values.
\item If OBJECT, an unsigned n (the number of elements) followed by n pairs of values.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\ttfamily jstream\+\_\+skip} function skips to the current value (if it is an array or an object skip all of it).

For an example, look at the file {\ttfamily jsondump.\+c} that uses {\ttfamily fgetc} as {\ttfamily get} and prints the result on the terminal (thus implements an echo for Json texts that drops space characters) to see how to use it in practice.

Enjoy, Paolo
